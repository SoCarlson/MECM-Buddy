# MECM-Buddy
MECM Buddy helps you download, update, and deploy SCCM apps automatically. 

# Introduction
I'm super excited to finally be sharing MECM Buddy with the world! This project aims to simplify the downloading, packaging, script running, and uploading apps to Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM) / System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM). It allows the creation and importing of recipes and simplifies deployments into one big process instead of several modules in MECM. 

# Dependencies
It relies on a few PowerShell module dependencies, like Evergreen (GitHub), ConfigurationManager (Microsoft), and having a local install of MECM and an internet connection. If you want to use VirusTotal, you need an API key. Additionally, you need to have Malwarebytes Nebula installed for that function to work. I also use and recommend PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit to make the user install experience better. 

# Notice
I'm a college student who is just getting started, so if you would like to contribute, please do!
